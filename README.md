### Pragmatic Unidirectional Data Flow for Android


MVI is a library that helps to implement unidirectional data flow in [Kotlin](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotlin) using [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) in the most simplistic manner possible. All API's are based on extension functions. Thanks to this design choice library plays well with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) or [Dagger/Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/).
